This is the jupyter notebook used in the tutorial "Simulating molecules using VQE" for the virtual summer school at Quantum Information and Quantum Technology (QIQT) 2021 on July 8th, 2021. 

Some examples of running VQE calculations for quantum chemistry porblems are shown.
1. Basic VQE calculation
2. Construct a potential energy curve
3. Reduce the problem size (Change the ansatz, Reduce the active space)

I ran this notebook in the following environment. 
Note that h5py >= 3 did not work in my case.

h5py==2.10.0
qiskit==0.27.0
qiskit-nature==0.1.3
pyscf==1.7.6.post1
